A collection of real-world CTF solutions, notes, exploits, and step-by-step walkthroughs focused on Solidity, EVM internals, and smart-contract hacking.
The goal of this repository is to provide simple, practical explanations of how to approach and solve common CTF patterns.

More writeups will be added as new challenges are completed.
